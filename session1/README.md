# Session 1 Inception

During the first session we will go over setting up a 'React' development environment using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
After looking at the sample app to understand how a react application works, we'll start building our weather application. If time allows we will refactor our code to use more ES6 features. By the end of the session we should have a web app allowing users to enter a city and get the current weather data for that city.

## Session Plan

### 1. Setting up the dev environment

1. Install `create-react-app` : `yarn global add create-react-app`
2. At the root of the repository run `create-react-app session1` to bootstrap a development / production React app.
3. Spin up the dev server by running `yarn start` in the `./session1` directory.

### 2. ES6 imports / exports

### 3. The React component model

1. The ES6 `class` construct
2. The react Component syntax
3. The react Component lifecycles
4. The react Component props
5. The react Component state

### 4. Coding session

1. Build the keyword search field component
2. Build the search result component
3. Component styling

### 5. ES6 refactor

1. Static properties
2. Arrow functions
3. Destructuring assignments
